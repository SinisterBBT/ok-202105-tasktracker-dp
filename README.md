Task Tracker project, Dmitrii Poliakov

## Main idea
One-page web app for students or any professionals and goal-oriented people who would like to have a single place
for keeping all of their goals and tasks in order.  

Monetization through context ad based on analyzing user goals.  

## User portrait
Predominantly young, methodical system-minded people with a high pace of life.
Usually come to our service from context ad in other study/work-related resources.

## User "pain-points" and our remedy
- Multiple task trackers for work, study and life which is tedious to maintain
- A lot of users use calendars instead of task tracker which is timeline-centric approach. 
  Goal-centric approach and implicit SMART-analyse can help people understand why do they do something.
  Maybe it is unnecessary.
